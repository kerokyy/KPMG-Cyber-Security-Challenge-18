KPMG Cyber Security Challenge 2018 writeup

https://home.kpmg.com/my/en/home/services/advisory/risk-consulting/emerging-tech-risk-and-cyber/kpmg-cyber-security-challenge.html

We joined the KPMG Cyber Security Challenge 2018 edition. These are the questions from the online national qualifier where we placed 6th out of 106 teams. 

The format is as follows:
-2 challenges will be released every two days
-The competition runs from Monday till Sunday night
-Capture the flag style competition

Unfortunately, we didn't manage to complete all the tasks and I will be providing our writeup that we submitted for all of the challenge but 2 of them will be without a flag. But I still believe that for purpose of learning, it will still be useful.

Tasks that we failed to complete:
Day1 - Challenge 2 & Day3 - Challenge 1
